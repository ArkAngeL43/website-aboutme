      <h1>Hackers for civilians</h1>
      <p>
          Why hello there, i am RE43P3R a programmer and red hat hacker with 4+ years of experince with hacking,
          there is a massive chance you found this page on github, instagram, or my .onion site if you did well
          you are going to learn a bit about me, what i do on a daily bassis, and what my belifes are when it comes
          to hacking 
      </p>
      <h2>
          why did i start?
      </h2>
      <p>
          well i first had an interest in OSINT, and then it went from there, during that time i had a shitty laptop,
          and something that i could most definitly not work much on, so i first started out with a vigilante org called
          F.O.G ( First Order Of Guardians) it was nice and the only way i helped was google dorking and remembering everything 
          i could at that time. further on in the while i was doing it, i had gotten enough money to build my pc and once i did 
          that then there it was, i got it, booted into linux, and started hacking and learning more as the days went on 
      </p>
